# Protoqueue - Implementation Progress

This document tracks our progress in implementing the features outlined in the roadmap.

## Completed Features

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Basic Architecture
- ✅ Set up project with TypeScript and dependencies
- ✅ Created Docker Compose for NATS JetStream
- ✅ Implemented basic Protoqueue class with NATS connection
- ✅ Set up message publishing (enqueue) and consumption (worker) 
- ✅ Implemented Protobuf schema for tasks
- ✅ Added Protobuf encoding/decoding in Protoqueue

### Phase 2: Task Management & Queue Functionality
- ✅ Implemented message acknowledgment system
- ✅ Added acknowledgment timeout configuration
- ✅ Built retry logic for failed tasks
- ✅ Implemented Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed tasks
- ✅ Added task metadata support (priority, timestamp, retries)

### Phase 3: Persistence & Monitoring
- ✅ Implemented task persistence in JetStream
- ✅ Added task status tracking
- ✅ Implemented basic queue statistics
- ✅ Set up stream configuration for task storage

### Phase 4: Advanced Queue Features
- ✅ Implemented task prioritization
- ✅ Added support for multiple workers to consume tasks
- ❌ Task deduplication
- ✅ Batch processing support

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
- ✅ Basic unit test structure
- ❌ Integration tests
- ❌ Performance optimization
- ❌ Stress testing

## Features In Progress

### Phase 4: Advanced Queue Features
- Implementing task deduplication to prevent processing the same task multiple times

### Phase 5: High Availability & Scalability
- Setting up NATS clustering for high availability
- Implementing fault tolerance for task processing

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
- Adding more comprehensive tests
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

## Upcoming Features

### Phase 7: Documentation & User Experience
- Expand documentation with more examples
- Package for NPM publishing
- Add usage examples for common scenarios
- Provide API documentation

### Phase 8: Final Review & Publishing
- Final code review and refinement
- Package for NPM
- Publish to NPM

## Known Issues & Limitations

- **Task Deduplication**: Not yet implemented
- **Error Handling**: More robust error handling needed in some areas
- **Testing**: Integration tests need to be expanded
- **Type Safety**: Improve TypeScript types for better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Implement task deduplication
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Expand test coverage
4. Optimize performance for high-throughput scenarios
5. Add more detailed documentation and examples
