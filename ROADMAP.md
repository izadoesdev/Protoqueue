Here’s a **full roadmap** for the Protoqueue project, broken down into simple, manageable phases. This roadmap ensures that we approach development in incremental stages while maintaining focus on key goals and features.

---

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup & Basic Architecture**
**Goal**: Set up the project environment, core dependencies, and basic queue functionality.

1. **Create Project Repository**  
   - Set up a GitHub repository for Protoqueue.
   - Initialize the project with `npm init` and basic dependencies.

2. **Set Up Docker Compose for NATS**  
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for easy local development with NATS.
   - Set up NATS container with JetStream enabled.

3. **Basic TypeScript Setup**  
   - Set up TypeScript in the project (`tsconfig.json`, `src` folder).
   - Install TypeScript and necessary development dependencies.

4. **Initial Protoqueue Class**  
   - Create a `Protoqueue` class in `src/index.ts` with basic queue functionality:
     - Initialize NATS connection.
     - Set up message publishing (enqueue).
     - Set up message consumption (worker).

5. **Basic Protobuf Schema**  
   - Define a simple Protobuf schema for the task messages (e.g., `task.proto`).
   - Implement Protobuf encoding/decoding in `Protoqueue`.

6. **Basic CLI Tool**  
   - Implement basic CLI to enqueue tasks and start a worker.

### **Phase 2: Task Management & Queue Functionality**
**Goal**: Add more advanced features for task management and enhance the queue functionality.

1. **Message Acknowledgment and Acknowledgment Timeout**  
   - Implement task acknowledgment in the consumer to mark tasks as completed or failed.
   - Add a timeout for message processing.

2. **Retries and Dead-letter Queue (DLQ)**  
   - Implement retry logic for failed tasks.
   - Set up a simple dead-letter queue (DLQ) to handle tasks that fail after multiple retries.

3. **Task Metadata**  
   - Extend the task schema to include metadata (e.g., `priority`, `timestamp`).
   - Implement metadata handling on both producer and consumer sides.

4. **CLI Enhancements**  
   - Enhance CLI for better task management (e.g., `--retry`, `--metadata` options).
   - Add a `status` command to check task statuses.

---

### **Phase 3: Persistence & Monitoring**
**Goal**: Introduce task persistence, logging, and monitoring capabilities.

1. **Persist Tasks in JetStream**  
   - Ensure that tasks are persisted in JetStream, allowing for durable queues and message replay.

2. **Task History/Logs**  
   - Implement task history logging (e.g., `success`, `failure`, `retry` logs).
   - Use a simple in-memory log or a file-based logging solution.

3. **Task Expiry and TTL (Time-To-Live)**  
   - Implement a TTL for tasks, automatically deleting tasks that expire.
   - Add the ability to configure TTL for tasks through metadata.

4. **Basic Monitoring**  
   - Add simple monitoring for queues (e.g., number of tasks in the queue, task processing rate).
   - Set up basic logging and error handling for the queue operations.

---

### **Phase 4: Advanced Queue Features**
**Goal**: Add more advanced queue features to improve robustness and scalability.

1. **Task Prioritization**  
   - Implement priority levels for tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
   - Modify the consumer to process high-priority tasks first.

2. **Worker Scaling**  
   - Allow multiple workers to consume tasks from the same queue.
   - Ensure proper load balancing between multiple workers.

3. **Task Deduplication**  
   - Implement task deduplication to prevent processing of the same task multiple times.

4. **Batch Processing**  
   - Add support for batch processing (e.g., processing a group of tasks at once).

---

### **Phase 5: High Availability & Scalability**
**Goal**: Ensure Protoqueue is scalable and highly available for production use.

1. **High Availability with NATS Clustering**  
   - Set up NATS clustering to ensure high availability for the queue system.
   - Ensure that Protoqueue can operate across multiple NATS nodes.

2. **Auto-Scaling Workers**  
   - Implement auto-scaling for workers based on queue length and processing demand.
   - Add a mechanism to scale the number of workers dynamically.

3. **Load Balancing**  
   - Implement simple load balancing between multiple consumers (workers).
   - Integrate with cloud-native solutions like Kubernetes for auto-scaling and load balancing.

4. **Fault Tolerance and Redundancy**  
   - Ensure fault tolerance in task processing (e.g., automatic retry in case of worker failure).
   - Implement redundancy for task data to avoid data loss.

---

### **Phase 6: Testing & Optimization**
**Goal**: Improve the performance and stability of the system.

1. **Unit & Integration Testing**  
   - Write unit tests for individual modules (e.g., `Protoqueue`, task handling).
   - Write integration tests for full queue processing (enqueue, consume, retry).

2. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Profile the system to identify bottlenecks in task processing and NATS communication.
   - Optimize message serialization and deserialization.

3. **Stress Testing**  
   - Conduct stress testing to determine how Protoqueue performs under heavy load.
   - Identify limits in throughput, queue size, and task processing time.

4. **Code Quality and Linting**  
   - Set up ESLint or another linter to maintain code quality.
   - Ensure the code follows best practices and is easy to maintain.

---

### **Phase 7: Documentation & User Experience**
**Goal**: Improve the user experience and provide complete documentation.

1. **User Documentation**  
   - Write clear documentation for setting up Protoqueue, including installation, configuration, and usage examples.
   - Create tutorials for common use cases (e.g., enqueueing tasks, building workers).

2. **CLI Enhancements for User Experience**  
   - Make the CLI more user-friendly (e.g., better help messages, input validation).
   - Provide detailed error messages and suggestions for troubleshooting.

3. **Docker Support for Production Deployment**  
   - Provide a ready-to-use Docker image for production deployment.
   - Document how to deploy Protoqueue in a production environment using Docker or Kubernetes.

4. **UI Dashboard (Optional)**  
   - Consider building a simple web UI to visualize queue status, task processing, retries, etc.
   - Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana for advanced metrics.

### **Phase 8: Final Review & Publishing**
**Goal**: Final preparations for public release.

1. **Code Review and Refinement**  
   - Perform a final code review, ensuring that all functionality is stable, efficient, and easy to use.
   - Refactor any code that doesn’t meet quality standards.

2. **Package for NPM**  
   - Package Protoqueue as an NPM module.
   - Ensure that the module is well-documented, tested, and ready for public use.

3. **Publish to NPM**  
   - Publish Protoqueue to NPM for public use.
   - Announce the project’s release and provide an easy-to-follow guide for first-time users.

4. **Community Engagement**  
   - Open-source the project and encourage community contributions.
   - Set up a roadmap and issue tracker for future enhancements.

### **Post-Launch Phase: Maintenance & Iteration**
**Goal**: Ensure Protoqueue remains reliable and up-to-date.

1. **Bug Fixes & Feature Requests**  
   - Address bugs and implement features requested by the community.
   - Monitor GitHub issues and pull requests regularly.

2. **Performance Improvements**  
   - Continue to optimize for better performance and scalability.
   - Respond to feedback on how Protoqueue is performing in real-world scenarios.

3. **Security Patches**  
   - Regularly update dependencies and fix any security vulnerabilities.
   - Monitor NATS and other libraries for potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Iterate on New Features**  
   - Based on user feedback, implement new features like advanced task prioritization, batch processing, and enhanced monitoring.

### **Summary**
This roadmap covers everything from the initial setup to post-launch maintenance. The phases are designed to ensure that the project is developed step-by-step, with features and stability added incrementally. By the end of Phase 8, Protoqueue will be a fully functional, production-ready system that can be used in real-world scenarios, with the option for continuous iteration and improvement.
